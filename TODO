# TODO - Stuff I gotta do.
----------------------------

* Live Editing
    - Buffered editing? [Frame 1] -> [Frame 2] 

* Bidirectional Highlighting
    - Something wrong with highlighting parsing.
    There are a few bugs with both ascii and hex highlighting - sometimes it highlights one byte more or one byte less.

* Large File Support
    - Buffered chunking? [Break the file into parts and load them into memory.]
